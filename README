Intro:

This software automatically monitors and stores the real-time (ex-post 5 minute) market prices, at every GXP/GIP in the
New Zealand Electricity Market.  

The script does the following:

    1. Connects to the NZX WITS FTP server with login details
    2. Determines the most likely name of the csv file that contains the most recent (with lag) prices.  This reduces the
       amount of FTP traffic on the WITS FTP server.  Some of the directories contail many files and a simple dir listing
       can take considerable bandwidth (and time).  
    3. Once the filename is guessed, it attempts to download the csv file.  If it fails, several other guesses are made
       (note: this could probably be improved) and if all guesses fail, then we have a gap in the data.  
    4. There is a lag (which can be set manually).  Currently, the delay is around 10 to 15 minutes.
    5. Once obtained, the csv file is parsed into memory from where it is directly loaded into a pandas dataframe and 
       added to the huge and growing live5.h5 hdf5 database file.  Various statistics are calculated and logged (easy 
       with pandas) and a weekly csv file (all_week.csv) saved that contains five minute price data for all gxps over a 
       rolling week.
    

Initial implementations of this code utilized loops in a single python process and would eventually fail (for one of many 
reasons).  To overcome this a linux box (running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) was set up and the operating system (CRON) used to 
run the python script on a five minute basis.   

This is currently achieved (as at 23 January 2013) with a linux box running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

The crontab line looks like this:
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/dave/python/wits_ftp/wits_ftp_opsys.py 
           --ftp_pass='password' --ftp_user='user' >> /home/dave/python/wits_ftp/wits_ftp_cron.log 2>&1

To monitor prices, all_prices.html, is used with a simple webserver.  This uses the awesome d3 javascript library and in
particular implements horizon charts (using cubism) over the week for each gxp.  Some of this could be improved in the 
future as currently the whole all_week.csv file is read every 5 minutes, where we should be able to set up a weekly data
base and just update the most recent values: -> todo.

ToDo: Lots of possible options, implement twitter feed for example.
